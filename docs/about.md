## About Me


Hello there, I am Cho from Hong Kong. I am currently taking a computer science master In Ireland. As a non-science background graduate, I would like to jot down keynotes that I have learnt and the thoughts on certain issue. I hope that this could structure my learning in a consistent way by writing it in an article. 

Thank you.
