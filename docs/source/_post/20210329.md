[14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/) 

### Question 
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string ```""```.

### Example
:::details
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

Output: "fl"

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]

Output: ""

Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
:::

### Intuition 
First, we take the item with the shortest characters. And use it to compare other items in an array. By comparison, each time the character of every other items is to compare with the item with the shortest characters. The execution will stop when it found any mismatch and return. 

```
Space Complexity: O (1)
Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
```

```js
var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {
    const checker = strs.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length);
    let low = checker.slice(0,1)
    let remain = checker.slice(1)
    let bool = true

    for (let i in low[0]){
        // console.log('outside',low[0][i])
        for ( let j in remain){
            if (low[0][i] !=remain[j][i] ){
                bool=false
                return low[0].slice(0,i)
            } 
        }
    }

    if ( bool = true){
        return ""+low
    }
};
```
