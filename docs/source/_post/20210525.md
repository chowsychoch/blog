[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### Question 
There is an integer array ```nums``` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, ```nums``` is rotated at an unknown pivot index ```k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]``` **(0-indexed)**. For example, ```[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]``` might be rotated at pivot index ```3 ```and become ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]```.

Given the array ```nums``` after the rotation and an integer ```target```, return the index of ```target``` if it is in ```nums```, or ```-1``` if it is not in ```nums```.

You must write an algorithm with ```O(log n)``` runtime complexity.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

### Solution 

I originally misunderstand the question as we have to generate the random k number and rearrange the number to get the target index. However, the question just ask us to implement a search function. 

Binary Search Approach - We use the same logic as binary search with modification. First, we use binary search to get the smallest element index. After we get the smallest element, we get the pivot index. 

Then we check if the target is between the range of pivot and the end of array. If it is the case, we set the boundary of two pointers and use binary search to get the result.

```Java
public class RotatedSortedArray {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        //edge case
        if (nums== null || nums.length == 0)return -1;
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length -1;

        while (left < right){
            //it breaks when we find the smallest element of array.
            int midpoint = left + (right -left) /2 ;
            //Check the element in the mid point is greater than right hand side
            //Normal case: sorted array, right hand side is always greater than midpoint --> assign right to midpoint
            //Rotated case: move left point to midpoint + 1;
            if (nums[midpoint] > nums[right]){
                left = midpoint + 1;
            }else{
                right = midpoint;
            }
        }


        //reset to regular binary search
        int start = left;
        left =0;
        right = nums.length-1;
        if (target >= nums[start] && target <= nums[right]){
            left = start;
        }else{
            right = start;
        }

        while (left <=right){
            int midpoint = left + (right -left)/2;
            if( nums[midpoint] == target){
                return midpoint;
            }else if (nums[midpoint] > target){
                right = midpoint - 1;
            }else{
                left = midpoint + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;

    }
