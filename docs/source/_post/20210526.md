[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

### Question
You are given an array ```prices``` where ```prices[i]``` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return ```0```.

### Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

### Solution 

Brute force approach - We can simply loop over each element and calculate all the possible profit outcome. Then we can get the highest profit outcome. However, This costs time complexity ```O(n^2)```. 

Another approach is to to keep track the min buy prices and calculate the max profit at the same time. We save the initial value of profit as 0 and buy price as max value. For each element, we iterating and check if the current price is smaller than the buy price. If it is we update it else we will compare the current profit with the max profit.

Space Complexity: O(1)

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max =0;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i=0; i < prices.length ; i++){
            if (prices[i] < min){
                min =prices[i];
            }else{
                max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - min);
            }

        }
        System.out.println(max);
        return max;

    }
}
```
