This article will discuss data structure of Array.

Arrays 

Trees

Tries

Stacks

Queues

Linked Lists

Graphs

Hash Tables 

Arrays is a list which helps to organize items sequentially.

Big-O Notation - Time Complexity 

Static
- lookup O(1)
- push   O(1) 
- insert O(n) 
- delete O(n)

Dynamic 
- Lookup O(1)
- Append *O(1) **can be O(n) on expanding memory
- Insert O(n)
- Delete O(n)

Array stored in contagious memory (in order). 

Insert O(n)
```js
const strings = ['a','b','c','d']
                  0   1   2   3
strings.unshift('x')
const strings = ['x','a','b','c','d']
                  0   1   2   3   4
                  //---> move index 
strings.splice(2,0,'alien')
```

# Two Types of Arrays: Static & Dynamics

Static - fixed in size. Allocated memory in advance. 

Dynamic - Copy an Array and relocate to new location (Usually doubling in size)


Javascript - reference type (non-primitive type) 

```js
var number = 1 
var number = 2

var object1 = { value:10} // store the address of memory 
// object 2 point to object1 
var object2 = object1 

var object3 = {value:10} // store the address of memory 

[] === [] 
// false
//Why it is false? Because they are comparing itself the memory. Not the type 
// context vs scope 

```
