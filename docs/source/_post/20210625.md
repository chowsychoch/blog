[206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### Question 
Given the ```head``` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return <i>the reversed list</i>.

### Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

```

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

### Solution 
Iterating the whole linked list until node reaches null.
For each loop, set up the next node first and set the curr.next pointer to previous. After that, move the previous node to current node and current node to next node. Return the previous node in the end. 

```java

    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummyhead = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode next = null;
        while ( current != null){
            next = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = next;
        }
        dummyhead.next = prev;
        return dummyhead.next;
    }

```
