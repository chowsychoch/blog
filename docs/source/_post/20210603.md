[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

### Question 
Given ```head```, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the ```next``` pointer. Internally, ```pos``` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's ```next``` pointer is connected to. **Note that ```pos``` is not passed as a parameter.**

Return ```true``` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return ```false```.

### Example 1:
<img :src="$withBase('https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png')" alt="leetcode11">

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

### Example 2:
<img :src="$withBase('https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png')" alt="leetcode11">

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

### Example 3:
<img :src="$withBase('https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png')" alt="leetcode11">

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

### Solution 1 

Two-pointers Approach - Set a two pointer, fast and slow to traverse from head node.
Each time fast pointer will move 2 steps forward while a slow pointer will move one step forward. 
While fast pointer is not match with slow pointer, it will continue running. The loop will break if the fast pointer reaches the end of node and if the two pointer found one another. 

::: theorem 
Space Complexity: O(1) 

Time Complexity: O(n)
:::

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {

        if ( head == null)return false;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        ListNode slow = head;

        while ( slow != fast ){

            if ( fast == null || fast.next == null){
                return false;
            }
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

```

### Solution 2 

Hash Table Approach - In this solution, hash set will be used to solve the problem. The idea is that we use hash table to record the unique node for each iteration until a duplicate one is found. We can say the linked list is a cycle one.
Note that we have to check the head and head.next is null or not. If it is, it will return false.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {

        HashSet<ListNode> h = new HashSet();
        if ( head == null )return false;
        if ( head.next == null) return false;

        while ( head != null){
            if (h.contains(head)){
                return true;
            }else{
                h.add(head);
                head = head.next;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
