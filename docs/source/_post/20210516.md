[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Question
Given n non-negative integers ```a1, a2, ..., an``` , where each represents a point at coordinate ```(i, ai)```. n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line ```i``` is at ```(i, ai)``` and ```(i, 0)```. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1: 
<img :src="$withBase('https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg')" alt="leetcode11">

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

### Example 3: 
```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

### Solution 
A rectangle area is calculated by **width * height**. We can use **Brute force approach** to calculate all the possible areas with for each height given in a loop and then to compare the result. However, it will cost ```O(n^2)```. And Java has runtime error if the given array is too large. 


### Two Pointer Approach
Another Solution will be used is to use two pointer to indicate the current height. As the rectangle is calculated with **width * height**. We use two pointer to indicate the two points. For each two points, we compare which one is shorter as we only need the shorter one to calculate the area. Then we replace the max area only if the current area is greater than max area. Finally, we shift the index of the pointer with shorter height.

### Java Version 

```Java
public class maxArea {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int maxArea = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        if ( height.length < 2 ){
            return maxArea;
        }

        while (left < right){
            int area = (right - left ) * (Math.min(height[left],height[right]));
            if (maxArea < area){
                maxArea = area;
            }
            if (height[left] < height[right]){
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
            }

        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
