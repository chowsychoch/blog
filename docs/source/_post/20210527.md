[125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

### Question
Given a string ```s```, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

### Solution

Two pointers appraoch - 
First, we need to modify the string - to include only letters and numeric values. After we recreate the string. We can use ```for (char c : s.toCharArray())``` to iterate over each char by converting them to array first and then we made sure to make them lower case. 

Then we use two pointers, one at the start of string, the other at the end of string. Each time, we check if both element is equal to each other, we return false if they are not match. Else, we continue to iterating each char inwards of a string.

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s){

        String fixed_string = "";
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()){
            if ( Character.isDigit(c) || Character.isLetter(c)){
                fixed_string+=c;
            }
        }
        fixed_string = fixed_string.toLowerCase();

        int a_pointer = 0;
        int b_pointer = fixed_string.length() -1 ;

        while (a_pointer < b_pointer){
            if (fixed_string.charAt(a_pointer) != fixed_string.charAt(b_pointer)){
                return false;
            }
            a_pointer++;
            b_pointer--;
        }
        return true;

    }
}
