[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### Question 
Given a string ```s```, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2: 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Example 4:

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

### Solution 1 
Sliding Window Algorithm - We need to iterate all of the characters of a string. 

We set two pointers at the start. i.e. a-pointer and b-pointer. For each character, we check if the character already contained in hash set. If it is, means that duplicate character is found and then we remove the duplicate in hash set. And we move a-pointer. If not, we put the character in hash table and move b-pointer. We compare the max value for each loop to see if the current hash set size is greater than the max value.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> hs = new HashSet();
        int a_pointer = 0;
        int b_pointer = 0;
        int max = 0;
        while ( b_pointer < s.length()){
            if ( !hs.contains(s.charAt(b_pointer))){
                //
                hs.add(s.charAt(b_pointer));
                b_pointer++;
            }else{
                hs.remove(s.charAt(a_pointer));
                a_pointer++;
            }
            max = Math.max(hs.size(),max);

        }
        return max;
    }
}

```

### Solution 2 
In this solution, we store a key-value pair in hash map. 
For the key, we store a unique character in hash map and store the current index + 1 as values. If the replica is found for this character, that is the start pointer should go. 

We perform similar approach as solution 1 and if the replica is found, we compare the starting index of a character and a-pointer and take the greater one.

        HashMap<Character, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();

        int b_pointer =0;
        int max= 0;

        while ( b_pointer < s.length()){
            if ( hm.containsKey(s.charAt(b_pointer))){
                a_pointer = Math.max(hm.get(s.charAt(b_pointer)),a_pointer );
            }
            max = Math.max(b_pointer - a_pointer +1,max);
            hm.put(s.charAt(b_pointer), b_pointer+1);
            b_pointer++;
        }
        return max;

    }
}

```
