[88. First unique character in a string](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/) 

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

### Example
:::details
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
:::

### Solution
The solution is solved with the use of hash table. To store each character when iterating the input. It will store the character and count by one in the hash table. 

As the solution wants to find the one and only character that is non-repeating. Again, iterating the map to find the character with count number equals to one. And iterating back to the the index position of the character. 

However, I found it quite repetitive to check which character has one count in hash table and iterate back to string to find index.

Better way of solving this is to store the character: index & frequency in hash table. 

The later I can iterate only once to find the first one with frequency one in hash table

Space Complexity: O(n) 
Time Complexity: O(n)
```

- Javascript Solution 
```js
var firstUniqChar = function(input) {
  // console.log(input)
  let map = {}
  //iterative from first to last char
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    if (map[input[i]] !== undefined) {
      map[input[i]] = map[input[i]]+1
      //  console.log(map)
    } else {
      map[input[i]] = 1
      //console.log(map)
    }
  }
  // return map
  let a
  for (let item in map){
    if (map[item] == 1){
      a = item
      // console.log(a)
      break
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i ++){
    if (input[i] == a){
      return i
    } 
  }
    
    return -1
};
```

- A Better Solution to save space

```js
var firstUniqChar = function(input) {
  // console.log(input)
  let map = {}
  //iterative from first to last char
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    console.log(map)

    if (map[input[i]] !== undefined) {

      map[input[i]].freq = map[input[i]].freq + 1

    } else {
      map[input[i]] = { idx: i, freq: 1 }

    }
  }
  for (let key in map){
    console.log(key)
    if (map[key].freq === 1 ){
      return map[key].idx

    }
  }
  return -1
}
```
