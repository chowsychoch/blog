This article will discuss data structure of Hash.


Hash Collisions (use the key and done)  
- Insert O(1)
- Lookup O(1) **depend on hash functions maybe O(n)
- Delete O(1)
- Search O(1)

Problems with Hash
Collisions - value after hash function is put in the same memory address of different keys 
O(n / k) k = size of hash functions 

trade off - fast access but more space!
