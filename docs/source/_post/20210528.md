[925. Long Pressed Name](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

### Question
Your friend is typing his ```name``` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character ```c```, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the ```typed``` characters of the keyboard. Return ```True``` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

### Example 1:

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
```
### Example 4:

```
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
```

### Solution 
Two pointers approach - Edge case in this problem is when the number of name is greater than typed, it is definitely false. 

In this problem, I have difficulty in setting condition in looping the range of two pointers. 

```java
        while ( nameInd < name.length() && typesInd < typed.length()){
```

The above is not correct. It will miss out the characters of typed after the length of name is reached. 

```
name: alex
typed: aaallexa
```

The ```a``` element will be missed out. 

Therefore, we need to iterate all the typed string. Then we check if the character of name equals to character of typed. If not we further check if the j index is 0 or the element of character in typed equals to previous. 

In this case, 
```
name: alex
typed: bbbblex
```
```
name:alex
typed: aaajex
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        if ( name.length() > typed.length())return false;

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0 ;

        while ( j < typed.length() ){
            if ( i < name.length() && name.charAt(i) == typed.charAt(j)){
                i ++;
            }else if (j == 0 || typed.charAt(j) != typed.charAt(j -1 )){
                return false;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return i == name.length();
    }
}
```
